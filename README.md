# PySerial-MCU-Communicator
This is a mini project designed to facilitate real-time communication between a computer and a microcontroller using the PySerial library. 

Its primary purpose is to serve as a foundational component for a larger project, with the long-term goal of transmitting battery data generated by [PyBaMM](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM) to embedded devices to enhance HIL emulation.

- Operational on the ESP32.
- Currently working on HAL UART commands for ARM mBed dev testing with the STM32 NUCLEO-F411RE & STM32L475.

### Running the communicator:
1)  ```
    pip install pyserial
    ```
2)  Be sure to update the COM port in python.
    ``
    port = serial.Serial("COM5", baudrate=115200, timeout=1)
    ``
3) Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4) Run the Python script by executing the following command: ``python pyserial_mcu_communicator.py
``
